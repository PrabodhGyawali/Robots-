# My Robotics Journey
Repo to store my Solidworks files for Robot Designs I have built over time.

Most designs are inspired from youtube videos. As they don't provide Solidwork files, I have gone ahead to following the videos and design it to share for everyone to be able to print the robot and build it.

Will add photos of completed builds when I get there.
