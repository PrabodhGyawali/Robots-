### The Story of Wardy

Wardy is the first robot I've built from scratch to initially learn CAD by watching this [video](https://youtu.be/WUIGY8ZHef8?si=kX-nrM1gqhMtNjjp). But since I had a 3D printer I thought might as well print the parts and code it.


After weeks of 
- printing parts, 
- assembling parts
- redesigning parts as dimensions didn't work
- ordering screws and servos on amazon 
- learning aluminum sheet metal bending as PLA is too weak to hold arm

Robot was finally assembled.

But this happened to be the easy part. 

I needed to code the robot, but didn't want to do Arduino as I wanted to learn low-level-systems so I fiddled with ESP-IDF. 

Along, the way I found a purpose for this robot which was to shake my phone throughout the day to increase my phone's step counter so that I can convert those steps to WeWard coins, with the eventual goal of cash conversion.
